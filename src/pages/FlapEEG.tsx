              FlapEEG is a video game that is controlled by thought. We have
              trained an AI model to interpret brain signals and translate them
              into actions in the game. For this to work, we equipped ourselves
              with the latest EEG (electroencephalogram) technology and and a
              lot of patience. It was hard at first, we needed to test with
              simple algorithms, but once we got the hang of it, we introduced
              our AI model and with trial and error, got it to understand the
              brain signals. The game is now fully functional and every thought
              you have counts: that's how you control your caracter!
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-justify">
              The format of the game is simple; ever heard of flappy bird? Well,
              it's the same simple yet fun concept. The only difference is that
              you control the bird with your thoughts. The simple will to make
              the little caracter avoid obstacles is enough to make it move. We
              are very proud of the work we have accomplished; it may only be
              the beginning of a video game revolution! Think about it, what if
              we combined this mechanic to a VR headset? 100% immersion, 100%
              fun! Or, what if this is the skipping stone to helping people with
              disabilities by giving them power from their own thoughts? The
              possibilities are endless.

              Just like any other project, FlapEEG had a beginning. It all
              started during the the spring semester of 2024. It was a rough
              start: we had many participants and loads of ideas, but the
              organisation was very hard to manage. Members came and went, and
              people of course had exmans and other things to attend which left
              us with a very different load of work to do.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-400">
              All that to say, that semester, we didn't get as much as we
              would've liked done, but in winter of 2025, we learnt from our
              experience and came back strong! We approached the project with a
              new concept: instead of open to everyone, we would screen the
              participants and make a choice based on their skills, their
              availability but most importantly, their interest in the project.
              This way, we were able to work much more efficiently and adress
              any issues immediately. It was indeed a great success! We were
              able to finish the first step of FlapEEG before our deadline: Make
              it work with a simple algorithm that would detect blinks. Our
              member Dereck worked on this and Louis-Étienne helped him fix the
              bugs. You can see on this preview the first prototype. In the
              meantime, our other members were working on finishing the game,
              researching and collecting data.

        <p className="text-gray-400 mt-6">
          It was only a rough prototype, as you can see, some latency was still
          present and the game was not fully functional. But it was a step in
          the right direction which led us to week 2...

          Collecting Data (Week 2 - Week 4)
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-400">
          After successfully the baseline, it was time to start collecting data.
          We needed to collect data from our participants to train our AI model
          to interpret brain signals. We had to find a way to collect this data
          and to make sure it was clean and usable. To do that, we asked many
          participants to perform a series of tests with the headset. We then
          hard Jordan and Dereck work on a way to clean the data and make it
          usable.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-400 mt-6">
          In the meantime, Louis-Étienne installed a server to centralize our
          datasets, William finished the game. Everything was slowly coming
          together, but the hardest part was yet to come!
